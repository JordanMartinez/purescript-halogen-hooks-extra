-- | Allows you to "push" events that occur inside a hook
-- | to a single handler outside of the hook. This allows the end user
-- | to use the full API returned by the hook when handling the event.
-- | Moreover, the end-user can set up resources on the first time
-- | the handler is run and unsubscribe when the finalizer is run.
-- |
-- | For example...
-- | ```
-- | -- let's say this is the end-user's Hook code
-- | onEvent <- useEvent
-- |
-- | -- Here, we'll inline the code for a hypothetical hook we found.
-- | -- This could be a hook provided by a library or something.
-- | { foo } <- Hooks.do
-- |
-- |   -- somewhere in the hypothetical hook, an event occurs
-- |   onEvent.push "user clicked foo"
-- |
-- |   -- return the value of the hook provided by the library
-- |   pure { foo: "foo" }
-- |
-- | Hooks.useLifecycleEffect do
-- |   unsubscribe <- onEvent.setCallback $ Just \setupSubscription str -> do
-- |     -- handle the event
-- |     Hooks.raise ("Event occurred: " <> str)
-- |
-- |     setupSubscription do
-- |       -- Then, set up some resources in this code block
-- |       -- that need to be cleaned up later
-- |       liftEffect $ log $ "Setting up resources."
-- |
-- |       pure do
-- |         -- now define the code that will run when we call
-- |         -- 'unsubscribe' later
-- |         liftEffect $ log $ "Cleaning up resources."
-- |
-- |   pure $ Just do
-- |     -- unsubscribe to clean up resources
-- |     unsubscribe
-- | ```
-- | If you don't need to unsubscribe, just ignore the first argument
-- | in the function passed to `onEvent`:
-- | ```
-- | state /\ tState <- useState 0
-- |
-- | Hooks.captures { state } Hooks.useTickEffect do
-- |   -- Notice two things here:
-- |   -- 1. we're ignoring the 'unsubscribeCallback' argument
-- |   --        by using the underscore (i.e. _).
-- |   -- 2. we're ignoring the returned 'unsubscribe' code by using `void`.
-- |   void $ onEvent \_ string -> do
-- |     -- handle the event
-- |     Hooks.raise ("Event occurred: " <> string)
-- |
-- |   pure Nothing -- no need to unsubscribe here
-- | ```
-- |
-- | ## Beware Infinite Loops
-- |
-- | If you use this hook, it's possible for you to create an infinite loop.
-- | This will occur if a handler runs code that causes another event to
-- | be emitted. Consider this workflow:
-- |
-- | 1. Event A is emitted
-- | 2. During A's handler, Action X is called
-- | 3. During Action X's computation, Event A is emitted.
-- | 4. An infinite loop occurs (go to Step 2)
-- |
-- | Here's an example in code:
-- | ```
-- | library <- useLibrary
-- | useLifecycleEffect do
-- |   library.onNewInteger \newInt -> do
-- |     library.setIntValue (newInt + 1)
-- | ```
-- | Consider also cases where the chain is longer and
-- | some computations run only when certain conditions are true:
-- |
-- | 1. Event A is emitted
-- | 2. During A's handler, Action X is called
-- | 3. During Action X's computation, Event B is emitted.
-- | 4. During B's handler, Action Y is called
-- | 5. During Action Y's computation, Event C is emitted but only if State M is equal to 4.
-- | 6. During C's handler, Action Z is called
-- | 7. During Action Z's computation, Event A is emitted.
-- | 8. Infinite loop may occur (depends on State M)
